       <h2>What is the Wildy Minecraft Server?</h2>
       <p>The AxleCraft.com Wildy Minecraft Server is a survival server that was released on January 10, 2022. Most of the world is a free wilderness where members decide how to govern their own domains. Only a few sanctuary zones are permanent safe areas like the Spawn Fortress. Members can strive to top the leaderboards in ranked PVP arena duels, 2v2, or clan capture the flag battles. Members can construct and defend their own domains in the wilderness. As a member you start out with nothing and must build a base to acquire resources & upgrade your gear. Ally with other members by joining a clan or registering your own, then construct team bases. If you made a legendary base in the wild, AxleCraft may feature it in a video. Members can schedule ranked PvP duels, arena fights, and epic clan capture the flag battles on the server Discord.</p>

        <h2>How to Join and Play on the Server</h2>
        <p>Members can join by donating $40 for server lifetime access, or donating $10 for 1 month of access. Paypal & most crypto coins are accepted. Everyone can get a free 2 week trial by completing the first active bounty. If you are interested in playing send an application to AxleCraft#2110 on Discord.</p>

       <h2>Server Status: <span class="live">Live</span></h2>
        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <p>In the wildy, the state of the world is up to the members. Admins reserve the right to ban to promote server quality, and to make sure all progress is earned. If you feel your ban was unjust send an appeal</p>
        <p>Warning: A ban and loss of membership will occur if you violate any of the the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>No hacks, exploits, duping, or modded clients are allowed. Anything that gives you an advantage is banned such as x-ray vision or auto diamond mining. If you are detected using a modded client or it is obvious that you are and other players report you, you will be banned</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont use obsidian or other similar blocks to obstruct spawn point (0,0), or to trap other players who cant escape from it</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont destroy the marked walled sanctuary zones, main highways or nether highways (+/- x, +/- z)</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>All names, language, and conduct must remain PG-rated since this server may be streamed</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont have any expectations of work from AxleCraft or admins, or refunds of donations</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Admins will never spawn items or cheat in any way. We want the server to be a top notch survival experience where each members effort affects the world</li>
        </ul>
       
       <p>If your application is missing data it will be denied. This application filtering is intended to create a high quality dedicated group of members on this server. You can use <a href="https://privnote.com/" target="_blank">https://privnote.com/</a> to send your application data over discord. Please dont send any coins until your application has been approved by AxleCraft unless you just want to donate to help the server, then thank you! If your application is approved, you can choose to donate to the wallet address provided. This contribution is a donation to AxleCraft and it can allow you to be whitelisted to join the minecraft server.</p>
       
        <h2>Server Lifetime</h2>
        <p>The server will continue to run with continued member support. The server will run for atleast 1 year (January 2022 to the end of December 2022). Devs might upgrade the server code and infrastructure with continued member support.</p>
        
        <h2>Most Crypto Coins Accepted</h2>
        <p>Most liquid coins and chains are supported. When you send in your application AxleCraft will notify you if the coin you want to use is not accepted before you send anything.</p>
        
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>If you make an awesome base, that is commendable in a wild environment and you might get featured in an AxleCraft video</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>If you have trouble connecting, message AxleCraft#2110 on Discord</li>
