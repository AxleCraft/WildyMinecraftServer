        <h2>What is the Wildy Minecraft Server?</h2>
        <p>The AxleCraft Wildy Minecraft Server is a members-only survival server where the entire world is a dangerous wilderness except a few sanctuary zones. You can choose to play solo and build a base far away to reduce the chance your base is found and looted, or you can form alliances with other players and cooperate to construct epic team bases. Members can choose whether they want to siege enemy fortresses, or live in harmony to create a tranquil utopia.</p>

        <h2>How to Join and Play on the Server</h2>
        <p>AxleCraft Wildy is a private whitelisted minecraft server. Members can join by donating $50 for server lifetime access, or donating $10 for 1 month of access. Most crypto coins are accepted. If you are interested in playing, send an application to AxleCraft#2110 on Discord</p>

        <h3>Your application must include the following information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Your email address</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Your minecraft username</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Your youtube username</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>The name and amount of coin that you want to send</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>The wallet address you want to send from</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>A statement saying youve read the rules and agree to them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If your application is missing data it will be denied. This application filtering is intended to create a high quality dedicated group of members on this server. <a href="https://privnote.com/" target="_blank">https://privnote.com/</a> is always an option to send your application data over discord. Please dont send any coins until your application has been approved by AxleCraft unless you just want to donate to help the server, then thank you! If your application is approved, you can choose to contribute $10 per month in one of the many coins supported. This contribution is a donation to AxleCraft and it can allow you to be whitelisted to join the minecraft server for the duration of your subscription. In order to renew your subscription, contribute the same amount each month from the same address. Contact AxleCraft before sending from a new address or coin.</p>
        <p>If you really want to play but cant afford to send a monthly contribution, active community members on youtube who watch and engage with the livestreams may be randomly granted access if they apply.</p>
        <p>Before applying, make sure you read and agree with the server rules below, then subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuRTfrdQAPOscepL_Y76bg" target="_blank">AxleCraft Youtube Channel</a> then message AxleCraft#2110 on Discord with your application.</p>
       
        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <p>In general there are no rules for gameplay, the rules are up to each individual member gamer since this is a wilderness server. Admins reserve the right to ban. If you feel your ban was unjust send an appeal</p>
        <p>Warning: A ban and loss of membership will occur if you violate any of the the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>No hacks, exploits, duping, or modded clients are allowed. Anything that gives you an advantage is banned such as x-ray vision or auto diamond mining. If you are detected using a modded client or it is obvious that you are and other players report you, you will be banned</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont use obsidian or other similar blocks to obstruct spawn point (0,0), or to trap other players who cant escape from it</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont destroy the main highways or nether highways (+/- x, +/- z)</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>All names, language, and conduct must remain PG-rated since this server may be streamed</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>Dont expect any work from AxleCraft or admins, or refunds of donations. Dont interpret anything on this page as a promise or intention to deliver something</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>Server Lifespan</h2>
        <p>The server hopefully will run perpetually if it can be sustained by members support. The server will run for atleast 1 year (January 2022 to the end of December 2022), however the server will continue to remain live if a few community members support it each month. Devs might upgrade the server code and infrastructure with continued member support.</p>
        
        <h2>Most Coins Accepted</h2>
        <p>Most liquid coins and chains are supported. When you send in your application AxleCraft will notify you if the coin you want to use is not accepted before you send anything.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>If you make an awesome base, that is commendable in a wild environment and you might get featured in an AxleCraft video</li>
            <li><span class="list_point"></span>If the server is down or you have trouble connecting, message AxleCraft#2110 on Discord</li>
        </ul>
